name: seneschal
version: 0.0.0.1
synopsis: A simple tool to run shell invocations in parallel
description: |
  Seneschal is written to solve the perennial ops problem - "why are we running
  this serially, when we could run it in parallel?"

  Often this is a valid complaint, and a place where there's significant
  opportunity for reducing time spent in whatever task is being scripted,
  whether it's updating a set of git repos, or pushing up images to ECR.

  Why use this, instead of `xargs --max-procs 0`, or GNU Parallel? Well, xargs
  takes some careful arrangement to use correctly, and GNU Parallel is very
  opinionated about... many things. The objective of this tool is to get out of
  your way and get you back to solving other problems.
